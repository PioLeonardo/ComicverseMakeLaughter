  - text: Haha, it's a shame, you've created a lot of accounts, and then it turns
      out that the function is just to get game bonuses. Many accounts, but the scope
      of friends does not increase. It really looks like an introvert and anti-social
      combo, haha.

  - text: Heyyy, there's nothing wrong with being anti-social. Change your joke,
      it's not funny, huuuu (audience disappointed).

  - text: (Damn, it turns out that there are many anti-social people here who can't
      be nudged).
